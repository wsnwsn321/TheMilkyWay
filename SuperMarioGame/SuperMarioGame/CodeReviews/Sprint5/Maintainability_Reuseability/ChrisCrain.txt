Specific Comments on code quality: 
The code has some high cyclomatic complexity.  It could probably be shortened or simplified, but it works well 
in the current implementation. 

This class works very well when a change to the game is needed.  If I need to add velocity
to another object, I just need to call the methods within the velocity.cs class to do so. 
This code has high reuseability, but the maintainability can be challenging due to the 
cyclomatic complexity issues.
