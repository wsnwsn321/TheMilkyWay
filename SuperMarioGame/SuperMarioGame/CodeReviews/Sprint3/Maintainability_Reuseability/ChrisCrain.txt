Specific Comments on code quality: 
Code is short, sweet, and to the point.  It's easy to read and is easy to manage or update if needed.

Let's suppose that I wanted to make a way to draw a sprite of a larger magnitude than the standard 
mario size.  This could easily be done in Nate's code by adding a parameter to draw and modifying
the desRectangle to scale accordingly. 

Another method of approach for scaled sprites would be to overload the draw method, one with only a 
vector as the param and the other with both the vector and the scale as a param. The code for 
Draw(Vector2 location) would just call Draw(Vector2 location, int scale) and pass 1 as the scale. 
This would make the code more maintainable when the time comes.
