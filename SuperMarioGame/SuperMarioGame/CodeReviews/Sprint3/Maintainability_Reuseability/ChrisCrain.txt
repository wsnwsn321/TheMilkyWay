Specific Comments on code quality: 
Code is short, sweet, and to the point.  It's easy to read and is easy to manage or update if needed.

Let's suppose I wanted to create another Goomba State called Goomba Fly State. In George's current 
implementation of the class, it should be really simple to modify his code to fit the changes.
All we would need is another method called Fly or GoombaFly that changes the goomba state to 
GoombaFly. It would be a simple and clean change.
