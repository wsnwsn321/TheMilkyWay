Comments:
For not having written any of this code, I found it to be fairly readable. I was able
to obtain a reasonable understanding of what was being completed in the class. Various
variable names such as controllerMappings and pressedKeys made it easy to understand 
exactly what was intended with the code logic itself. The only readability issue I found
was that there was a small indentation inconsistency, which was easily fixed.
