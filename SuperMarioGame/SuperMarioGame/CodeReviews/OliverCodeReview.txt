Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

Mario class basiclly build the structure for mario, it builds the constructor and contains the definition for state and functions
for mario to action and transformation.
the code is highly readable and greatly designed.

  public  const  int MARIO_SMALL = 1, MARIO_BIG = 2, MARIO_FIRE = 3; 

this line of code is readble because it specifically gives names for integer values which make readers clearly what all those
numbers represent.
