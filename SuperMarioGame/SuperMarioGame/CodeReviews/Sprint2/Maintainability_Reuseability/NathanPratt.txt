Specific Comments on code quality:
This class contains many properties that a high quality piece of code should have.
This class has high cohesion; the class exhibits a very simple and concise structure
that contains code that is all very related to its purpose.
The class also has loose coupling; MarioBigCommand is dependant on only one outside piece
of code.
There are also no conditional branches in this class, making the cyclomatic complexity nonexistent.

There is really no hypothetical change I would like to make to the class. If there were something that
needed to be fixed or changed, it would be very simple to implement because of the high quality of the
class.
