Specific Comments on code quality:
Clear and straight-forward class to create all the sprites related to mario.
Since there's a lot of mario sprites because we have many mario states, the code seems to be a liitle long, but I think the format 
is easy to follow and what the functions do are understandable.


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to the file being reviewed:
loading all the spritesheets and create all the sprites are necessary. the code is highly cohesive and lossely coupled. Great work.
