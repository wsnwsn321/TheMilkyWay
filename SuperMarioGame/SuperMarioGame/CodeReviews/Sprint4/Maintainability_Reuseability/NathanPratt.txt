Specific Comments on code quality:
This class contains many properties that a high quality piece of code should have.
This class has high cohesion; the class exhibits a very simple and concise structure
that contains code that is all very related to its purpose, althought it does have many
branches.
The class also has loose coupling.

The cyclomatic complexity is a bit high in this class but there is not really a better way of handling what the class
needs to do.

There is really no hypothetical change I would like to make to the class. If there were something that
needed to be fixed or changed, it would be very simple to implement because of the relatively high quality of the
class.
