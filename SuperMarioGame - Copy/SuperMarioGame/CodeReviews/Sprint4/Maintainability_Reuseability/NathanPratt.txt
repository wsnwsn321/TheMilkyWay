Specific Comments on code quality:
This class has a very high cyclomatic complexity compared to some of the other classes, although it has
relatively low cohesion and loose coupling.
If I were to make a hypothetical change to this class, I would develop a better system for determining which 
block piece specifically I was currently working with. This would help with decrease the cyclomatic complexity.
